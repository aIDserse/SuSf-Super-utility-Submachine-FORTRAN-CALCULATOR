# SuSf-super-utility-machine, but in Fortran <br>
It has same functions of the original!<br>
The calculator has commas and signs!<br>
This version has no brackets, simply because the fortran layout makes them only unuseful<br>
A special thanks goes to the Force 2.0 IDE creator, mr. Guilherme Lepsch, who helped me a lot giving me tips with the ide!<br>
If you want you can use the code for inspiration :)
