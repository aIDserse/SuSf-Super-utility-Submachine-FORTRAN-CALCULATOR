# Only version - 2.0<br>
This is the definitive (and the only one) update of this project.<br>
It has 14 funcions, pre-compiled version is inclueded in the releases<br>
When I'll have a Mac maybye I'll give a pre-compiled version for it too<br>
The code is in English<br>
When you do an operation, it says "Do you want to do another operation?" and if you say yes it returns to the beginning <br>
When there is the computing process, it prints "computing..." making it in a more 50s way.<br>
This version is the only one released for this project, it is simply a translation of my project "SuS" in Fortran, and does almost the same stuff, 
except for brackest (that are unuseful for the Fortran printing layout" and at the question "Do you want to do another operation?" you can answer only Y/N<br>
I used Force 2.0<br>
You can use my code in your project and take inspiration from it ;)
